All new components should follow this pattern for Admin editability:

```typescript
interface EditableComponentProps {
  data: any;
  config?: ConfigOptions;
  isEditMode?: boolean;
  onConfigChange?: (newConfig: ConfigOptions) => void;
}
```

This allows the same component to be used in:
- Teacher/Sales dashboards (read-only)
- Admin dashboard (editable configuration)

### Database Design Principles
